# pll-flaskr - Model Deployment Project
Premier Lacrosse League ML Project and Flask Deployment Project

### Background
- The purpose of this project was to create a ML model and deploy it to a flask personal website.
- The code in this repository contains the file necessary for that deployment.

### Process
- The prior steps to this project involved analyzing years of PLL game level data then using that data to create models capable of predicting game scores and a model capable of predicting game results.
- The model was then saved to a pkl file and deployed through a flask website.
- The result was a website that allowed users to visit, select two lacrosse teams and see a projected outcome of the ensuing game.
- It also included functionality to navigate to other pages include a professional experience page and an 'About Me' page.

 Enjoy!
